# Getting Started with Containers and Kubernetes: A DigitalOcean Meetup Kit

This repository equips a speaker with the materials necessary to deliver a roughly 45-minute-long introductory talk on containers and Kubernetes.

## Materials

The meetup kit includes the following resources:

- The "Getting Started with Containers and Kubernetes" [Slides and speaker notes](TODO: link) with commands for running a live demo
- This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/do-community/k8s-intro-meetup-kit) containing the demo app code
- A "Getting Started with Containers and Kubernetes" [DigitalOcean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/meetup_kits/getting-started-with-containers-and-kubernetes-a-digitalocean-meetup-kit), which walks a user through rolling out the demo "Hello World" [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) app on a [DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/) cluster.
